This is likely to occur if the model is provided with uninformative attributes during training. One solution is to try reducting noise in the training data by fixing any errors and removing outliers. Another potential cause of overfitting is when the dataset is too small. The solution here is to gather more training data. Finally, the model may overfit a dataset that includes uninformative attributes. The solution here is to simplify the model by using fewer features."
